DEPLOYMENT GUIDE: Navigate AI on Vercel

This project is configured for a "monorepo" style deployment on Vercel, where the React frontend and the Node.js serverless API live in the same repository.

1. PREPARATION
   - Ensure you have a GitHub account and a Vercel account.
   - Push your latest code (including the new `api/*.js` files) to your GitHub repository.

2. DEPLOYMENT STEPS
   a. Go to https://vercel.com/new
   b. Import your "NAVIGATE_AI" repository.
   c. Vercel should automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`.
      - Framework Preset: Create React App (or Other) is fine.
      - Root Directory: ./ (Leave as default)
      - Build Command: (Default is fine, handled by vercel.json)
      - Output Directory: (Default is fine, handled by vercel.json)

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   In the "Environment Variables" section of the deployment screen (or later in Settings), add the following.
   These are required for the frontend to talk to the backend correctly.

   | Key | Value | Description |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | GROQ_API_KEY | <your_groq_api_key> | Required for real AI responses. |
   | REACT_APP_AGENT_USE_PROXY | true | Tells frontend to use the serverless API. |
   | REACT_APP_LLM_PROXY_URL | /api | Points frontend to the Vercel functions. |
   | REACT_APP_AGENT_PROVIDER | groq | Sets default provider to Groq. |
   | REACT_APP_AGENT_ALLOW_REAL | true | Enables real API calls. |
   | GROQ_API_URL | https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions | (Optional) API endpoint override. |

   Note: You do NOT need to set REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY if using the proxy (recommended).

4. FINALIZE
   - Click "Deploy".
   - Vercel will build the React app and deploy the functions in `api/` as serverless endpoints.

5. VERIFICATION
   Once deployed, open your Vercel URL (e.g., https://navigate-ai.vercel.app).
   - The frontend should load.
   - Test the API by asking "visa from Lagos to USA" in the chat.
   - If it works, the frontend successfully communicated with `/api/llm`.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If the chat fails, check the "Logs" tab in your Vercel dashboard.
- Look for errors in the "Functions" logs for `api/llm`.
- Ensure `REACT_APP_LLM_PROXY_URL` was correctly set to `/api` in the code (I have already done this for you in `.env`).
